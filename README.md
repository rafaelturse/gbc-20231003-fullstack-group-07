# GIT Flow
- Never work directly at **MAIN** branch
- Create a branch in your name and work only on it
- ALWAYS try a **"git pull origin main"** before starting working in your branch

# GIT Branches
- To find your branch, do not forget to **"git fetch"** before **checkout**
- To change your branch try **"git checkout [YOUR_BRANCH_NAME]"**
